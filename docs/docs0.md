# Overview

The New Maps Project Map Analysis site is a web application to visualize, draw, and analyze congressional districts. Create an account to save the maps you draw. 

For each map, import all the precinct data, with optional additional information like percent demographics. Draw the district map by assigning precincts to districts. Calculate statistics regarding population distribution, compactness of the districts, and demographic representation for every map drawn. You can go back and edit your map, and then recalculate the statistics to get a desired map drawing.

There will be an interactive map where you can visualize all your districts by color, as well as bar graphs to show the distribution of various statistics regarding the districts and population.

## Importing Data

Import a plain text file with the name and population of each precinct. You may also choose to import demographics information for each file. The format of the file is specified on the upload popup, and is compatible with the input files in The New Maps Project's datastore.

## Assigning Districts

Once all the precincts are imported, you will see the precincts show on the map to visualize. click on a precinct on the map or search for it on the precinct list, and you can freely change it's district assignment. 

The map is very flexible and interactive and you can easily see the districts in different colors.

## Analyzing a Map

You can calculate the stats of a map at any time. It will show some basic stats like mean, median and standard deviation of the district populations and compactness, as well as bar charts and histograms of the entire dataset. You can also select certain demographic parameters to specifically analyze district representation, population distribution, and compactness of that specific demographic. 

If you are unsatisfied with these statistics, you are free to edit your map and recalculate the statistics until you find a map that has the statistics you desire.
