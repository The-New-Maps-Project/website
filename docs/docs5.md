# Packing & Cracking Districts in the Browswer

This browser feature will run on the maps in the Editing Suite, with the purpose of maximizing or minimizing a certain parameter in a selected district, while keeping the district relatively continuous and compact, and keeping the district populations relatively uniform.

## Goal

Maximize or minimize a parameter in a specific district while preserving as much compactness continuity, and population uniformity (for all the districts) as possible. Please note that there is **no guarantee** of continuity, or improved or unchanged compactness (measured by ASDPC), or improved or unchanged population uniformity (measured by RSD).

The Packing/Cracking Algorithm was created for this purpose
